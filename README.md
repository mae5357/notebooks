## Cancer Cell Sample Visualization using T-SNE

I wanted to explore the mechanics behind the dimentionality reduction tool “[t-SNE](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf?fbcl)”. To demonstrate through a real-life example, I used the [NKI Breast Cancer](https://data.world/deviramanan2016/nki-breast-cancer-data) dataset which contains 273 samples of over 1000 gene attributes. I was able to use t-SNE to plot these samples in 2D.
